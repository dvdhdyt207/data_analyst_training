# Data Analyst Portfolio – freeCodeCamp Projects

Welcome to my Data Analyst training repository! This collection of projects was completed as part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification**. The projects cover core data analysis skills using powerful Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

Each project is based on real-world datasets and challenges, allowing me to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization — essential skills for any aspiring data analyst.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 📌 1. Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator
A Python function that calculates mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum across rows, columns, and the entire matrix using **NumPy**. Input is a 3x3 matrix formed from a list of 9 numbers.

### 📌 2. Demographic Data Analyzer
Using **Pandas**, I analyzed data from the 1994 U.S. Census to explore demographic patterns such as race distribution, average age by gender, and the impact of education on income levels.

### 📌 3. Medical Data Visualizer
This project dives into health metrics and lifestyle choices using a medical examination dataset. With **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**, I visualized correlations via heatmaps and bar charts after preprocessing and cleaning the data.

### 📌 4. Time Series Visualizer
Visualization of forum page views over time (2016–2019). Generated line plots, bar charts, and box plots using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas** to highlight seasonal trends and fluctuations.

### 📌 5. Sea Level Predictor
Analyzed and forecasted sea level rise from 1880 to 2050. Utilized **Scipy** for linear regression modeling and **Matplotlib** to visualize both historical and predicted trends.
