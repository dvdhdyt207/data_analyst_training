# Data Analyst Training

This repository is dedicated to Data Analyst training using various Python libraries, including **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. The projects in this repository are part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum and focus on applying data analysis techniques to real-world datasets.

## Projects

### Project 1: Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator
In this project, you will create a Python function using **NumPy** to compute the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a 3x3 matrix. The input is a list of 9 digits, which is converted into a 3x3 NumPy array. The function returns these statistics for the rows, columns, and the entire matrix.

### Project 2: Demographic Data Analysis
Analyze a dataset from the 1994 Census using **Pandas** to answer questions related to race, age, education, and salary. The project requires you to calculate various metrics, including race representation, the average age of men, and salary percentages based on education level and more.

### Project 3: Medical Data Visualization
This project explores the relationships between body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices in relation to cardiac diseases. Using **Pandas** and **Seaborn**, the project includes tasks like data cleaning, generating categorical plots, and drawing heatmaps to understand correlations in the medical data.

### Project 4: Time Series Data Visualization
You will visualize time-series data of forum page views from freeCodeCamp from 2016-2019 using **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**. The project involves creating line charts, bar plots, and box plots to understand the trends and seasonal variations in page views.

### Project 5: Sea Level Change Analysis
Analyze the global average sea level change dataset since 1880. You will use **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to plot the rise in sea level and predict future changes through 2050 using linear regression models based on historical data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For an interactive coding environment.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scipy**: For linear regression analysis.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kepergok/data_analyst_training.git
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks for each project and run the code.
